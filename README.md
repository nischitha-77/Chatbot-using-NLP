# Chatbot-using-NLP

This project implements a chatbot using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques powered by NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) for text preprocessing and Scikit-learn for machine learning. The chatbot is designed to respond to user input intelligently based on predefined intents and responses. A user-friendly interface is built using Streamlit for easy interaction.

 Features

- Text preprocessing using NLTK (tokenization, lemmatization, etc.)
- Machine learning model using Scikit-learn (Naive Bayes classifier for intent recognition)
- Interactive chatbot interface using Streamlit
- Customizable intents and responses
